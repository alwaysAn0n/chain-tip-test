### Things I cannot remember

Below is a list of things I know exist but can't quite remember what they're called.  Submit a PR that adds the name and you'll receive a bounty.

1. The name of the actor that was in that movie where he slid around the house in his underware, singing into a candlestick.  Later that actor got really weird and super into scientology.  That actor's name was ___________________

2. There's a thing that functions as a purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.  The name of that thing is e-cash.

3. The name of that fat orange cat that loves lasagna is Garfield!
